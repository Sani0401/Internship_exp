1. Internship Projects.
-> During the internship the project that I was working.
they wanted system where user could get the 360 degree image of of the place where user click on the map.
--> here we had the data as photos that must be displayed on the screen, so firstly we have to extract the coordinates where the image was taken.
It was stored as a meta data in the image.
--> we extracted them and named the image file as that of the coordinates.
--> Then we stored the data onto the AWS S3.
--> Then Using the Mapbox GL JS library we implemented the functionality.
--> The mapbox provided us the basemap, wherein we added the evenlistner of click.
--> whenever the user clicks the map, it dynamicall gets the coordinates and makes the HTTP request to s3.
--> If the image is present on the server corresponding to the coordinates we display the image in pop up allowing user to view it in 360.
--> we also added the functionality of taking the input of coordinates and then impleenting the same thing.

--> Talking about the similiarity of the project we have google maps which displays same thing.

--> About the approach, I could say understanding the actual requirement or problem. Then figuring out what are the ways I know that we could do it. Then validating those ways and tyring to solve it.

--> Talking about things that I looked for over satckoverflow. The extraction of coordinates from the image.

--> Things that I learned, I was not aware of how do we extract metadata from a particular image and also that the coordinates that we extracted are in diffrent format. (There are two format of storing coordinates.)
